gethopeserve
============

Custom functionality built for gethope.net allowing people to sign up for serving opportunities and internal staff to get notified. All managed through Wordpress and using the Mandrill API to send notification emails.

This part has two components: A custom plugin and custom theme.  Only those parts are posted here, not all the other files that go into a Wordpress installation.
